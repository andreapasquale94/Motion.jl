# Motion.jl

**Motion.jl** is a Julia toolkit for **multi-body trajectory design** and **mission analysis**, with a 
focus on the dynamical environments commonly used in astrodynamics: **three-body** and **four-body** 
(restricted) models.

The goal of Motion is straightforward: provide *everything you typically need* to prototype, analyze, 
and optimize trajectories in multi-body systems — from dynamics and propagation, to invariant objects 
(libration points, manifolds), to shooting-based optimization workflows.
